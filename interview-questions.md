# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is like asking the code a question, and then giving it instructions based on wether or not that question is true, given the data provided. for example, say we tell the code that apples are the same as oranges. we then say to the code "if apples are the same as oranges, do a backflip." The code will check to see if apples are the same as oranges, and seeing that apples are indeed the exact same thing as oranges because we told it so, does a backflip in response.


Researched answer:


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is 'version control' software, used to track modifications to and facilitate the transfer of data. GitHub is a website based storage solution used to distribute, share, and store code.

Researched answer: GitHub is the central repository that Git software stores and makes available(publicly and/or privately) said projects.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Comparison and logic operators. anything not modifying data itself but checking data against something. such as === (strict equality, or "is X the exact same as Y?"), >= ("is X greater than or equal to Y?") or && (logical AND, or "are both of these things true?")

Researched answer: The Logical operators AND, OR, and NOT

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An Index is a characters positional data. a value is the content, or datatype of a character.

Researched answer: An Index is a number that indicate the location of a piece of data within a javascript object. a Value in Javascript is more like the container for a given set of information such as an array or function.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: arrays are lists, strings are sets of plaintext characters in a specific order, such as a word or sentence. BOth may contain letters and numbers, but a number in a string is interpreted by the code as the same thing as a letter. arrays can contain strings, but can also hold 'raw' numbers that math can be done on.

Researched answer: I don't feel like I have anything to add after more research.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The 'Driver': responsible for typing the code, making minor syntax adjustments, correcting spelling errors.
             The 'Navigator': responsible for the overall direction of the code being created, doing extra research where required, and any more moderate changes to the syntax required.

Researched answer: After some more research, seems to me like the 'Navigator' role should just be renamed to 'backseat driver'...

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a Function that operates on another function.

"Yo dawg, I heard you like functions..."

2. Jest: A Javascript testing program that helps you see just how borked your code is.

"Javascript+Test=?"

3. Objects: A container for Javascript data, can hold multiple different categories inside itself to be manipulated by other things.
 
 "It's a box."

4. Method: Actions that can be performed on objects

"Kinda like verbs. or magic spells, but nerdier!"

5. Classes: Templates for creating objects.

"It's the mold you make boxes with."
